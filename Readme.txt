CVND - SLAM


This is a 2d representation of the SLAM model used in Self Driving cars.

SLAM stands for Landmark detection and robot tracking.

This project is basically the implementation of kalman filters. Through this developement we re able to track 
robots location in time using landmarks.
For this we first give our robot object some sense and move functions.
NOTE - Noise has been deduced and implemented in this project.
This model works on a 2D graph.

The first notebook basically tells us the implementation of our robot_car.py class. Through which we are able to implement Kalman features.


This Robot Car moves in 2 Dimensional graph plotted with display world Function(also provided).

As well as accuracy increases as we run the simulation 20 - 30 times so as for robot to grasp the location of the landmarks and itself.
